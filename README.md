# PhraseLock-Bridge

Interactive, native installers for deploying the Phrase-Lock
backend and its optional reverse-tunnel proxy. Each installer is a
self-contained `install.sh` driven by `whiptail` (or `dialog` on macOS, for
local testing) — plain question/confirm dialogs, no manual config editing.
**PhraseLock-bridge** is required if you want run your own Keepass Installation
as a backend solution.  

## Goal

Every customer gets a backend that is entirely theirs — running on
hardware they own, reachable only by their own devices, with no
third-party service ever seeing their data or credentials. These
installers exist to make that self-hosted setup achievable without deep
Linux/PKI expertise: a guided install to answer, not a manual to follow.

## Architecture

```


PCs and smartphones are the two actual communication endpoints — everything
between them is infrastructure you **fully own and control**, end to end.
What's actually running in there (`PLPServer`, and optionally
`PLPProxyServer`/`PLPProxyClient` for devices without a fixed IP) is broken
down in the sections below.

## What ends up on the target system

Not the installer package's own layout — this is every file and every
symlink each `install.sh` actually leaves behind on the machine it was run
on. Where an entry has a `→`, that file is not real content of its own —
it's a pointer, reusing the one real file it points to, so the same
certificate/key never has to exist twice.

**PLPServer** — the customer device (e.g. Raspberry Pi):

## Certificate flow between installers

The three installers generate two entirely separate certificate authorities
— there is no shared PKI between `PLPServer` and `PLPProxyServer`. Each CA's
output only ever leaves its own installer through one manual, deliberately
un-automated copy step:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph S["PLPServer/pki-scripts/server"]
        SCA[Server CA + server cert]
        SCA --> P12["Bootstrap client .p12<br/>(make_client.sh)"]
    end
    P12 -->|you copy this| PCMac["PC / Mac certificate store<br/>(Current User / login keychain)"]

    subgraph P["PLPProxyServer/pki-scripts/server"]
        PCA[Proxy CA + server cert]
        PCA --> FRPCert["frp client cert<br/>(make_client_frp.sh)"]
    end
    FRPCert -->|you copy this| CI["PLPProxyClient/certs-in/"]
```

## Common conventions across all three installers

- **Idempotent**: re-running `install.sh` reuses what already exists (CA,
  certificates, passwords) instead of regenerating it, and only asks again
  for values that are genuinely missing.
- **PKI persisted outside `/tmp`**: the installer package is extracted into
  a staging directory, but generated keys/certificates are copied to a
  permanent location (`/opt/phraselock/...`) on first run, since `/tmp` can
  be cleared on reboot.
- **`README.txt` + `credentials.txt`**: every installer leaves a
  `README.txt` (safe to read/share — explains what was set up and what
  manual step, if any, remains) and, where secrets are involved, a
  separate `credentials.txt` (root-only, `chmod 600`) next to it. Both are
  regenerated at the end of a successful run with the actual resolved
  values, not placeholders.
- **Cancel/Esc-safe prompts**: every `whiptail` input is guarded so
  cancelling an interactive prompt aborts with a clear message instead of
  silently exiting.

tar xzf PLPServer-0.1.1.tar.gz

tar xzf PLPProxyClient-0.1.1.tar.gz
```

## PLPServer

Installs the customer-facing stack: nginx (mTLS-protected API reverse
proxy), mosquitto (MQTT broker with client-certificate trust store),
`plp-custom` (Java 21 service, installed as a systemd unit), and generates
this device's own PKI (server CA, server certificate, MQTT client CA, and
a bootstrap client `.p12` for API access from a PC/Mac).

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[API / app traffic] -->|mTLS :443| N[nginx] --> C[plp-custom]
    M[MQTT traffic] -->|mTLS :8883| Q[mosquitto]

    style A fill:#dbeafe,stroke:#2563eb
    style M fill:#fef3c7,stroke:#d97706
```

```
cd PLPServer
./install.sh
```

Asks once for the server's public IP/hostname, an MQTT broker
username/password, and a password to protect the generated client `.p12`.
See `/opt/phraselock/README.txt` afterward for how to import the `.p12`
certificate (Windows: "Current User" store; Mac: "login" keychain).

## PLPProxyServer

Installs the central reverse-tunnel proxy: `frps` (downloaded binary, not
a package) plus an nginx `stream{}` block doing plain TCP forwarding (no
TLS termination — that still happens on the customer device). Deliberately
**single-tenant**: fixed ports, one client certificate issued automatically
per installation. Multi-tenant proxying is out of scope by design.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    In[Incoming :443 / :8883] --> N[nginx stream forward] --> F[frps] -->|tunnel| Out[PLPProxyClient]
```

```
cd PLPProxyServer
./install.sh
```

Asks for the proxy's public IP/hostname and a name for the one client it
serves. Also supports importing an existing CA (via `certs-in/ca.key` +
`ca.pem`) when migrating this proxy to new hardware, so already-issued
client certificates stay valid.

## PLPProxyClient

Installs `frpc` on the customer device, tunneling its local ports 443 and
8883 out to a `PLPProxyServer`. Does **not** generate its own PKI — the
client certificate must be issued by the proxy server (`make_client_frp.sh`
there) and copied manually into `certs-in/` before running this installer.
That manual transfer step is intentional: whoever controls it controls the
resulting trust relationship, so it's not automated.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Frpc[frpc] <-->|tunnel| Server[PLPProxyServer]
    Frpc --> Local[Local :443 / :8883<br/>PLPServer]
```

```
cd PLPProxyClient
# copy the 3 certificate files from the proxy server into certs-in/ first
./install.sh
```

Asks for the proxy server's address and its `auth.token`.

## Testing

Each installer was built and verified against dedicated test
infrastructure mirroring the two real deployment targets (a Raspberry Pi
and a cloud VPS), including a full end-to-end run with real client devices
communicating through the complete tunnel chain.
